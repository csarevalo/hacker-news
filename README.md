# Hacker News

Find top stories from Hacker News! Satisfy your curiousity with gratifying intellectual content on the web. Enjoy.

Built with Flutter, Sqflite, and Hacker News API.

P.S. Wondering about Hacker News's guideline, well here it is: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.

## Purpose
Learn to develop flutter apps using Provider, and compare its benefits to BLoC which separates presentation from business logic and gauge its benefits. This app was presented with BLoC in my coursework, I chose to use Provider to verify if the process was simpler. Conclusion, provider is more straight forward to deliver information to widgets, and BLoC, although need more boiler plate code, is very useful between the states of app or feature.

There was also the added bonus of getting introduce to local databases with Sqflite and testing.

This project is essentially the culmination to Stephen Grider's course "Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide" available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide). The knowledge of getting started on learning BLoC state management has been invaluable.
